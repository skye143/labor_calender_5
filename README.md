# labor_calender_5


<!-- This is my Advanced CSS Challenge submission, where I have created a professional portfolio by writing the HTML and CSS from scratch. The portfolio will be updated with my work over time. I have utilized my knowledge gained during the first two weeks of my bootcamp to ensure the following requirements are met:

- The website is divided into multiple sections, including About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
- Functional navigation links have been included at the top of the page, which allow the user to easily navigate to any of the website sections.
- The My Work section includes interactive links that showcase other websites and sample programs.
- I have included a recent photo of myself.
- The My Work section features projects that illustrate my work, including examples of other websites and sample programs.
- The page has been designed to be responsive, ensuring that it works seamlessly across different screen sizes, including tablets and mobile phones.
- I have also added on-hover effects to the links and projects on the page. -->
