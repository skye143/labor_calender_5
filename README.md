# labor_calender_5

This is my submission for the Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler. I created a work day scheduler from scratch by writing HTML, CSS, JS, and utilizing Day.js. I applied the knowledge I gained during my bootcamp to ensure that the following requirements were met:

- The website is interactive and functional.
- Each time block has a color that adjusts based on the time of day.
- The current day is displayed at the top of the page.
- I included a "Save" button, instead of just the word "Save".
- The website saves the information entered into the time blocks into local storage.
- Every time the page is refreshed, the information in the text boxes remains where the user placed it.
- I also added on-hover effects to the buttons on the page.
